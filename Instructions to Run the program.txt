1) Make sure you have python and the following python libraries/packages installed: 

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
keras
tensorflow
pandas-datareader
scikit-learn or sklearn

If you don't have some of the packages installed, open command prompt/terminal and type : pip install package_name

2) Make sure you have an internet connection


3) Select the cryptocurrency whose price you want to predict by chaning the value of the varible "curr_crypto". 
 
By default it is set to curr_crypto='ETH' for Ethereum price prediction. You can change it to:

curr_crypto='BTC' for Bitcoin, curr_crypto='XRP' for Ripple or curr_crypto='XMR' for Monero.


4) You can also change the currency against which the cryptocurrency prices are predicted, by default is is set to 'GBP'
This can be changed by changing the value of the variable "curr_against".

Example: curr_against='USD' for US dollars.

5) Run the python script "CryptoPrediction.py" and please wait to get the results.

Thanks!
